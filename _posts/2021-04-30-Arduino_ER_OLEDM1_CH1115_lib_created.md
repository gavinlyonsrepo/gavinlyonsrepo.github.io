* Name : ER_OLEDM1_CH1115
* Title : Library to support the ER-OLEDM1.09-1 128X64 OLED Display Module driven by the CH1115 controller for the Arduino eco-system.
* Description : 

1. Arduino library.      
2. Inverse colour, vertical rotate, sleep, fade effect, horizontal scroll and contrast control. 
3. Extended ASCII scalable font. 
4. Graphics class included, based on the Adafruit GFX library.
5. 3 different modes: Multi-buffer , single buffer , no buffer.
6. Bitmaps supported.
7. Hardware & software SPI options

* Author: Gavin Lyons
* Arduino IDE: 1.8.10

* Tested on following MCUs both software and hardware SPI,
The example files are setup for an UNO for the pin connections used 
by for other MCU testing see extras folder, GPIO_MCU_used.txt file.
1. Arduino  UNO & NANO v3
2. ESP8266 
3. ESP32 
4. STM32 "blue pill"
