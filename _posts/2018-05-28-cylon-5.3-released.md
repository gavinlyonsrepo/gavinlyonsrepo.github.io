### Version 5.3-5 280518

* Minor update caused by pacman 5.1 release breaking stuff.
* pacman 5.1 update has split misc tools into new separate package, called pacman-contrib. 
* Some of these tools are needed, so added pacman-contribs as a dependency to cylon,
* Also pacman-optimise tool now obsolete and permanently removed, so option removed from pacman menu.
